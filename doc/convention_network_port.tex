\subsection{Network Ports}

A designation for a network port consists of a room and a port number seperated
by dash ``-'' and a checksum.

\begin{figure}[H]
	Room: 212; Port: 6 \\
	Basic designation: 212-6 \\

	Caclulation of the checksum:
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{i=0}^{n} result[i] &= 66 \\
		66 \mod 34 &= 32 \hat{=} X
	\end{align*}

	The complete designation will be ``212-6X''.

	\caption{Example network port designation}
\end{figure}

The designation should be written at the top of the network port. \\


If your network port has two RJ45-plugs, a second row with the letters ``A'' and
``B'' under the designation is required. ``A'' will always be the left ``B'' the
right.
For fiber ports (or network ports that are turned $90^{\circ}$) the top will
always be ``A'' and ``B'' always the bottom. If possible, write the letters
\underline{left} beside the RJ45- / fiber-plugs.
