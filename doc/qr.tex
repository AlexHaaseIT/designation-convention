\section{QR codes}

	\caption{Example network port designation}
\end{wrapfigure}

For better maintenance a QR code could be added to designation labels, so the
customer or maintenance stuff is able to scan the information instead of typing
it in the device. It is recommended, to print it a little bit bigger than
required, so that it is still scanable unter bad conditions. \\

\textbf{Note:} The QR code should contain the \underline{full} designation
includuding the designation identifier.
