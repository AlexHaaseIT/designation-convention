\section{Specification}

\textit{All designations are constructed according to the following pattern, if
not otherwise specified in the relevant specification.} \\


A designation starts with an one to three alphanumerical ``device identifier''
followed by a alphanumeric ``ID string'' and terminated by the checksum as
defined in chapter \ref{chap:checksum}. The ``device identifier''
\underline{must} begin with letters and may be continued with a number. If
numbers are used in the ``device identifier'', a hypen must seperate the
``device identifier'' and ``ID string''. \\

The maximum length of the whole designation \underline{without hyphens} is 10. A
group of characters between hyphens may not be longer than 4 characters.
